	<p style="font: caption;">Just like architecture, which is an art used by people daily and affects their everyday life, so is code. 
	You can create something and people interact with, use, touch and work with. That is an amazing feeling.<br>
	Since code is a usable art, a whole team of people are connected to the practice. From the client to the account managers, and including 
	the business people, finance, the support team, QA team, designers, product managers and project managers.<br>
	Code touches every single person in the organization and makes a difference to every single user that touches it (for good or bad).<br>
	The sense of accomplishment when solving a really complicated problem cannot be beat! It just feels as if you have been at the best party
	in town.</br></p>
	
	<p style="font: caption;">My "Hometown" is the largest and most-populous city in the U.S. state of Michigan, the largest U.S. city on the United Statesâ€“Canada 
	border, and the seat of Wayne County. The municipality of Detroit had a 2019 estimated population of 670,031, making it the 24th-most 
	populous city in the United States.</p>
